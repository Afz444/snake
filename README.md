A simple clone of the snake game, developed as my first attempt at using `canvas` and Javascript.

It was originally intended for the [0hgame jam](http://0hgame.eu), but couldn't make it on time. 

A demo used to be available live, but no more. You can run it easily in [repl.it](https://repl.it/github/xurxodiz/snake) if you have an account, though.

Thankful mention to [Bill Mill's tutorial](http://billmill.org/static/canvastutorial/), my starting point.
